<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Clinical Quality Language Specification defines a representation for the expression of clinical knowledge that can be used within both the Clinical Decision Support (CDS) and Clinical Quality Measurement (CQM) domains. Although several standards exist for the expression of clinical quality logic, these standards are not widely adopted and present various barriers to point-to-point sharing of clinical knowledge artifacts such as lack of tooling, complexity of implementation, or insufficient expressivity.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Rather than attempt to address these shortcomings in one of the existing standards, this specification provides a solution to enable shared understanding of clinical knowledge by defining a syntax-independent, canonical representation of logic that can be used to express the knowledge in any given artifact, and point-to-point sharing by defining a serialization for that representation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The canonical representation, the Expression Logical Model (ELM), is informed conceptually by the requirements of the clinical quality domains of measurement and improvement, and technically by compiler design best practices. The resulting canonical representation provides a basis for sharing logic in a way that is at once verifiable, computable, and can serve as the input to language processing applications such as translation, tooling, or even execution engines.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In addition, this specification introduces a high-level, domain-specific language, Clinical Quality Language (CQL), focused on clinical quality and targeted at measure and decision support artifact authors. This high-level syntax can then be rendered in the canonical representation provided by ELM.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Clinical Decision Support and Clinical Quality Measurement are closely related, share many common requirements, and both support improving healthcare quality. However, the standards used for the electronic representation of CDS and CQM artifacts have not been developed in consideration of each other, and the domains use different approaches to the representation of patient data and computable expression logic. The first step in enabling a harmonization of these approaches is clearly identifying the various components involved in the specification of quality artifacts, and then establishing as a principle the notion that they should be treated independently. Broadly, the components of an artifact involve specifying:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Metadata – Information about the artifact such as its identifier and version, what health topics it covers, supporting evidence, related artifacts, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Clinical Quality Information – The structure and content of the clinical data involved in the artifact</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Expression Logic – The actual knowledge and reasoning being communicated by the artifact</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Considering each of these components separately, the next step involves identifying the relationship of the current specifications to each component, as shown in the following table:</p>

<p>Following this overall structure, this specification focuses on the common representation of expression logic that CQM and CDS-specific artifact standards can then reference. Separate specifications address metadata and data model. Note, however, that the QUICK specification, and the Quality Improvement Core (QICore) Profiles are being developed concurrently with this specification to ensure that the two specifications interoperate effectively.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In addition, this specification is designed to be data model independent, meaning that CQL and ELM have no explicit dependencies on any aspect of any particular data model. Rather, the specification allows for any data model to be used, so long as a suitable description of that data model is supplied. Chapter 7 of this specification discusses how that description is supplied, and what facilities an implementation must support in order to enable complete data model independence of CQL and ELM.</p>

<h2 id="approach"><a class="anchor" href="#approach"></a>3. Approach</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As discussed in Section 1.1, one key principle underlying the current harmonization efforts is the separation of responsibilities within an artifact into <em>metadata</em>, <em>clinical information</em>, and <em>expression logic</em>. Focusing on the expression logic component and identifying the requirements common to both quality measurement and decision support, the Clinical Decision Support HL7 Work Group produced a harmonized conceptual requirements document: <em>HL7 Domain Analysis Model: Harmonization of Health Quality Artifact Reasoning and Expression Logic.</em> These requirements form the basis for the reasoning capabilities that this specification provides.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Building on those conceptual requirements, this specification defines the logical and physical layers necessary to achieve the goal of a unified specification for expression logic for use by both the clinical quality and decision support domains.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Broadly, this specification can be viewed from three perspectives:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Author – The author perspective is concerned with clearly and correctly communicating and interpreting the semantics defined at the conceptual level, from a human perspective.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Logical – The logical perspective is concerned with representing the semantics of expressions in the simplest complete way.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Physical – The physical perspective is concerned with clearly and correctly communicating or interpreting the semantics defined at the logical level, from a machine perspective.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In other words, the logical level of the specification can be thought of as a complete bi-directional mapping between the author and physical levels. The various components involved in the specification are then concerned with ensuring that semantics can be clearly communicated through each of these levels.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="author-perspective"><a class="anchor" href="#author-perspective"></a>3.1. Author Perspective</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At the highest level, the author perspective is concerned with the human-readable description of clinical quality logic. This level is represented within this specification as a high-level syntax called Clinical Quality Language (CQL). CQL is a domain-specific language for clinical quality and is intended to be usable by clinical domain experts to both author and read clinical knowledge.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The author perspective is informed conceptually by the Quality Data Model (QDM), the current conceptual representation of electronic clinical quality measures. This heritage is intended to provide familiarity and continuity for authors coming from the quality space.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="logical-perspective"><a class="anchor" href="#logical-perspective"></a>3.2. Logical Perspective</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The logical perspective of the specification is concerned with complete and accurate representation of the semantics involved in the expression of quality logic, independent of the syntax in which that logic is rendered.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For the logical layer, this specification defines a Unified Modeling Language (UML) model called the Expression Logical Model (ELM) that defines a canonical representation of expression logic. This approach is intended to simplify implementation and machine processing by focusing on the content of an expression, rather than the syntax used to render it. The approach is based on and motivated by the concept of an Abstract Syntax Tree from traditional compiler implementation. The following diagram depicts the steps performed by a traditional compiler:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><span class="image"><img src="extracted-media/media/image3.png" alt="image" width="626" height="430"/></span>Figure 1‑B</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As shown here, the ELM representation is defined as an Abstract Syntax Tree, eliminating the need for lexical analysis and parsing steps, and allowing implementations to concentrate on the core representation of the logic.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In addition, this approach avoids potential ambiguity that must be resolved with operator precedence and/or the use of parentheses in traditional expression languages.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The result is a dramatic reduction in the complexity of processing quality artifacts, whether that processing involves translation to another format, evaluation of the logic, or building a user-interface for authoring or visual representation of the artifact.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The logical perspective is informed conceptually by the HL7 Version 3 Standard: Clinical Decision Support Knowledge Artifact Specification, Release 1.2 (CDS KAS), a prior version of a standard for the representation of clinical decision support artifacts. This heritage is intended to provide familiarity and continuity for authors and consumers in the decision support space. The current version of that standard, Release 1.3, has been updated to use the ELM as defined in this specification.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="physical-perspective"><a class="anchor" href="#physical-perspective"></a>3.3. Physical Perspective</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The physical perspective is concerned with the implementation and communication aspects of the logical model—specifically, with how the canonical representation of expression logic is shared between producers and consumers. This specification defines an XML schema representation of the ELM for this purpose, describes the intended semantics of CQL, and discusses various implementation approaches.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Knowledge Artifact Specification is an HL7 Standard for the representation of clinical decision support artifacts such as order sets, documentation templates, and event-condition-action rules. The original version (and through release 1.2) of that specification included an XML-based syntax for encoding the logic involved in the knowledge artifacts. The Expression Logical Model defined by this specification is a derivative of that XML-based syntax, and in release 1.3 of KAS, the syntax was updated to reference this specification.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>FHIR is an HL7 standard for enabling healthcare interoperability by defining a framework for reliable data exchange. The Clinical Reasoning Module of FHIR describes how Clinical Quality Language can be used within FHIR to represent the logic involved in knowledge artifacts.</p>

<h3 id="fhirpath"><a class="anchor" href="#fhirpath"></a>7.4. FHIRPath</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>FHIRPath is an HL7 specification for a path-based navigation and extraction language, somewhat like XPath. CQL is a superset of FHIRPath, meaning that any valid FHIRPath expression is also a valid CQL expression. This allows CQL to easily express path navigation in hierarchical data models. For more information, see the Using FHIRPath topic in the Developer’s Guide.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The organization of this specification follows the outline of the perspectives discussed in the Approach section—conceptual, logical, and physical. Below is a listing of the chapters with a short summary of the content of each.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="01-introduction.html">Chapter 1</a> – Introduction provides introductory and background material for the specification.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="02-authorsguide.html">Chapter 2</a> – Author’s Guide provides a high-level discussion of the Clinical Quality Language syntax. This discussion is a self-contained introduction to the language targeted at clinical quality authors.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="03-developersguide.html">Chapter 3</a> – Developer’s Guide provides a more in-depth look at the Clinical Quality Language targeted at developers familiar with typical development languages such as Java, C#, and SQL.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="04-logicalspecification.html">Chapter 4</a> – Logical Specification provides a complete description of the elements that can be used to represent quality logic. Note that Chapters 2 and 3 describe the same functional capabilities of the language, and that anything that can be expressed in one mechanism can be equivalently expressed in the other.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="05-languagesemantics.html">Chapter 5</a> – Language Semantics describes the intended semantics of the language, covering topics such as data layer integration and expected run-time behavior.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="06-translationsemantics.html">Chapter 6</a> – Translation Semantics describes the mapping between CQL and ELM, as well as outlines for how to perform translation from CQL to ELM, and vice versa.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="07-physicalrepresentation.html">Chapter 7</a> – Physical Representation is reference documentation for the XML schema used to persist ELM.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="08-a-cqlsyntax.html">Appendix A – CQL Syntax Formal Specification</a> discusses the ANTLR4 grammar for the Clinical Quality Language.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="09-b-cqlreference.html">Appendix B</a> – CQL Reference provides a complete reference for the types and operators available in CQL, and is intended to be used by authors and developers alike.</p>
